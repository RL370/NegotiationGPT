multiparty_0013.xlsx,Speaker 1,Six months after phase one completion.,IR,IR
multiparty_0013.xlsx,Speaker 3,What would phase two cost?,QB,QB
multiparty_0013.xlsx,Speaker 1,Approximately $150000.,IR,IR
multiparty_0013.xlsx,Speaker 2,So $500000 total just spread over time?,QB,QB
multiparty_0013.xlsx,Speaker 1,Correct but with less upfront investment.,AGR,AGR
multiparty_0013.xlsx,Speaker 3,That works better for our cash flow.,AGR,AGR

multiparty_0013.xlsx,Speaker 2,How much additional?,QB,QB
multiparty_0013.xlsx,Speaker 1,About $50000 more for extra developers.,IR,IR

multiparty_0033.xlsx,Speaker 1,Approximately $150000.,IR,IR

multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 3,I think pricing should be our first priority.,IP,IP
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 2,I agree. Let's start there.,AGR,AGR
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 1,Our initial proposal is $500000.,IP,IP

multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 3,We could start with basic infrastructure.,CS,CS
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 1,That would reduce costs but limit growth capacity.,SB,SB
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 2,What would basic infrastructure cost?,QB,QB
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 1,We could reduce to $100000 for basic setup.,IP,IP
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 3,That brings total to $450000.,IR,IR

multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 3,Core features first then enhancements in phase two.,IR,IR
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 2,That could reduce initial costs significantly.,AGR,AGR
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 1,Phase one alone would be $350000.,IP,IP
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 3,That's more reasonable.,AGR,AGR
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 2,When would phase two begin?,QP,QP
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 1,Six months after phase one completion.,IR,IR
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 3,What would phase two cost?,QB,QB
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 1,Approximately $150000.,IR,IR
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 2,So $500000 total just spread over time?,QB,QB
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 1,Correct but with less upfront investment.,AGR,AGR
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 3,That works better for our cash flow.,AGR,AGR
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 2,I'm comfortable with this approach.,AGR,AGR
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 1,Great. Should we discuss the equity split?,P1,P1

multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 2,How much additional?,QB,QB
multiparty_0117.xlsx,Speaker 1,About $50000 more for extra developers.,IR,IR
